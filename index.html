      <p>The first thing I Love is travelling. I Traveled to 23 countries until now, Including USA, Countries in South America such as Cuba, Colombia, Mexico. European Countries are always the first choice, because of flight availabilities and price of course. There's nothing better then waking up at random times of the day, picking up your luggage and going out of your house and safe zone, to see and experience something new and unseen :)</p>

      <p>Since I was a kid, my father was a big influence on tinkering with things, whether it would be cars, motorcycles, audio electronics or just simple maintenence around the house. But the two things that stole my heart was - LEGO and Building anything with PC and Console related. Till now I have around 80 different LEGO sets, and I Hope, I can still play with them after the recommended age of 99 :)</p>

      <p>Night Rides - there is something magical taking a ride in your car or on your motorcycle after a hard day. After Sundown you meet -  inner peace. All the stress, hard days work, family/friend problems all vanish when you turn the key and lights on. Just cruise the empty streets to empty your mind, and restart your body for the next day :)</p>
